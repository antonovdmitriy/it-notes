# Java tricks

## Main method trics

Allowed final word in main main method and arguments
```java
public final static void main(final String[] args) {}
```

## Compile and Run

If file doesn't contain any public class it can named any. After compiling this name of file will be vanish, and we get several file with classes.

If file contain main method and package name then java after javac doesn't invoke main method if we launch it from the package directory, it can not find main method to handle this
```
javac packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java
```
of with wildcard
```
javac packagea/*.java packageb/*.java
```

then run it with package 
```
java packageb.ClassB
```

`javac` creates by default class at the same directories. It's not goot enough. It's useful to specify a directory for classes for created package structure and put compiled files there.
```
javac -d classes packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java
```
this command created classes folder and package structure and then compiled java classes to class files.

after that from current directory it's possible to run this programe with class path options. There are several ways to do that:
```
java -cp classes packageb.ClassB
java -classpath classes packageb.ClassB
java --class-path classes packageb.ClassB
```
On Windows, you type the following:
```
java -cp ".;C:\temp\someOtherLocation;c:\temp\myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
```

And on macOS/Linux, you type this:
```
java -cp ".:/tmp/someOtherLocation:/tmp/myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
```
The period `.`indicates that you want to include the current directory in the classpath. The rest of the command says to look for loose class files (or packages) in someOtherLocation and within myJar.jar. Windows uses semicolons `;` to separate parts of the classpath; other operating systems use colons.

Just like when you're compiling, you can use a wildcard (*) to match all the JARs in a directory. Here's an example:
```
java -cp "C:\temp\directoryWithJars\*" myPackage.MyClass
```
This command will add to the classpath all the JARs that are in directoryWithJars. It won't include any JARs in the classpath that are in a subdirectory of directoryWithJars.

## Create Jar via CLI

create jar with classes and packages from the current folder
```
jar -cvf myNewFile.jar .
jar --create --verbose --file myNewFile.jar .
```
with '-C' option to specify directory with classes
```
jar -cvf myNewFile.jar -C dir .
```

## Main arguments trics
---
use quates for arguments with spaces
```
javac Zoo.java
java Zoo "San Diego" Zoo
```
---
single file source code - compile and launch with one command and pass parameters
```
java Zoo.java Bronx Zoo
```

## Import packages tricks

The import statement doesn't bring in child packages, fields, or methods; it imports only classes directly under the package

---

When we use multiple import sql classes and date from util. We need explicitly write date class
```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.sql.*;
```
if it will be that , then it's compile error
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.sql.*;  // causes Date declaration to not compile
```

## Initializing class

> Sometimes code blocks are inside a method. These are run when the method is called. Other times, code blocks appear outside a method. These are called **instance initializers**

> Class can have name started with lower case. 

## Numeric literals

- Octal (digits 0–7), which uses the number 0 as a prefix—for example, 017.
- Hexadecimal (digits 0–9 and letters A–F/a–f), which uses 0x or 0X as a prefix—for example, 0xFF, 0xff, 0XFf. Hexadecimal is case insensitive, so all of these examples mean the same value.
- Binary (digits 0–1), which uses the number 0 followed by b or B as a prefix—for example, 0b10, 0B10.

## Underscores

You can add underscores anywhere except at the beginning of a literal, the end of a literal, right before a decimal point, or right after a decimal point. You can even place multiple underscore characters next to each other, although we don't recommend it.

Let's look at a few examples:

```java
double notAtStart = _1000.00;          // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notAtEnd = 1000.00_;            // DOES NOT COMPILE
double notByDecimal = 1000_.00;        // DOES NOT COMPILE
double annoyingButLegal = 1_00_0.0_0;  // Ugly, but compiles
double reallyUgly = 1__________2;      // Also compiles
```

## Wrapper classes

| Primitive type | Wrapper class | inherits Number? | Example of creating         |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------- |
| boolean	    | Boolean        | No	            | `Boolean.valueOf(true)`     |
| byte	        | Byte	         | Yes       	    | `Byte.valueOf((byte) 1)`    |
| short	        | Short   	     | Yes              | `Short.valueOf((short) 1)`  |
| int	        | Integer	     | Yes	            | `Integer.valueOf(1)`        |
| long          | Long           | Yes              | `Long.valueOf(1)`           |
| float	        | Float	         | Yes	            | `Float.valueOf((float) 1.0)`|
| double	    | Double	     | Yes	            | `Double.valueOf(1.0)`       |
| char          | Character	     | No	            | `Character.valueOf('c')`    |

There is also a `valueOf()` variant that converts a String into the wrapper class and `parse()`
```java
int primitive = Integer.parseInt("123");
Integer wrapper = Integer.valueOf("123");
```

All of the numeric classes in Table extend the `Number` class, which means they all come with some useful helper methods: `byteValue()`, `shortValue()`, `intValue()`, `longValue()`, `floatValue()`, and `doubleValue()`. 

```java
public abstract class Number implements java.io.Serializable {
    public Number() {super();}
    public abstract int intValue();
    public abstract long longValue();
    public abstract float floatValue();
    public abstract double doubleValue();
    public byte byteValue() {
        return (byte)intValue();
    }
    public short shortValue() {
        return (short)intValue();
    }
}
```


The `Boolean` and `Character` wrapper classes include `booleanValue()` and `charValue()`, respectively.

## Text blocks

> new line after first """ or compile error

> quates inside may be with escaping \ or not

> spaces at the end of the line are ignored but we can use \s

![Example](images/text_blocks_1.png)

![Escaping rules](images/text_blocks_2.png)

## Naming

- Identifiers must begin with a letter, a currency symbol, or a `_` symbol. Currency symbols include dollar `$`, yuan `¥`, euro `€`, and so on.
- Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
- A single underscore `_` is not allowed as an identifier.
- You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.

## Variables declaration and initizlization

initialized only `i3`
```java
void paintFence() {
   int i1, i2, i3 = 0;
}
```

Different types in one statement do not compile
```java
int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

```java
boolean b1, b2; // COMPILE
String s1 = "1", s2; // COMPILE
double d1, double d2; // DOES NOT COMPILE. Use one double in this case double d1, d2;
int i1; int i2; // COMPILE
int i3; i4; // DOES NOT COMPILE. Statement is finished ; and next statement without type
```

```java
public void findAnswer(boolean check) {
   int answer;
   int otherAnswer;
   int onlyOneBranch;
   if (check) {
      onlyOneBranch = 1;
      answer = 1;
   } else {
      answer = 2;
   }
   System.out.println(answer);
   System.out.println(onlyOneBranch);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

```java
public void checkAnswer() {
   boolean value;
   findAnswer(value);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

> Instance and class variables (static) do not require you to initialize them. As soon as you declare these variables, they are given a default value. The compiler doesn't know what value to use and so wants the simplest value it can give the type: null for an object, zero for the numeric types, and false for a boolean. You don't need to know the default value for char, but in case you are curious, it is '\u0000' (NUL).

### Var
> local variable type inference. Let's take that apart. First comes **local** variable. This means just what it sounds like. You can only use this feature for local variables.

> The compiler looks at the code **on the line of the declaration** and uses it to infer the type

```java
public class VarKeyword {
   var tricky = "Hello"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

```java
public void reassignment() {
   var number = 7;
   number = 4;
   number = "five";  // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

```java
public void breakingDeclaration() {
   var silly
      = 1;
}
```

```java
 public void doesThisCompile(boolean check) {
    var question; // DOES NOT COMPILE
    question = 1;
    var answer;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
    if (check) {
       answer = 2;
    } else {
       answer = 3;
    }
    System.out.println(answer);
 }
```

По идее при присвоении null можно было подставлять Object в var но дизайнеры языка решили не давать такое скомплировать, потому что скорее всего автор такого кода что-то не продумал.
```java
public void twoTypes() {
   int a, var b = 3;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
   var n = null;      // DOES NOT COMPILE
   var fall = 2, autumn = 2; // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

```java
public int addition(var a, var b) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
   return a + b;
}
```

>var is not a reserved word and allowed to be used as an identifier. It is considered a reserved type name. A reserved type name means it cannot be used to define a type, such as a class, interface, or enum

```java
package var; 
public class Var {
   public void var() {
      var var = "var";
   }
   public void Var() {
      Var var = new Var();
   }
}
```

## Eligibility for GC
```java
 public class Scope {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       String one, two;
       one = new String("a");
       two = new String("b");
       one = two;
       String three = one;
       one = null;
    } }
```
## Operators

### Order of operator precedence


| Operator                        | Symbols and examples                             | Evaluation    | 
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|

| Other unary operators           | `- ! ~ + (type)`                                 | Right-to-left |
| Cast                            | `(Type)reference`                                | Right-to-left |
| Multiplication/division/modulus | `* / %`                                          | Left-to-right |
| Addition/subtraction            | `+ -`                                            | Left-to-right |
| Shift operators                 | `<< >> >>>`                                      | Left-to-right |
| Relational operators            | `< > <= >= instanceof`                           | Left-to-right |
| Logical AND                     | `&`                                              | Left-to-right |
| Logical exclusive OR            | `^`                                              | Left-to-right |
| Logical inclusive OR            | `\|`                                              | Left-to-right |
| Conditional AND                 | `&&`                                             | Left-to-right |
| Conditional OR                  | `\|\|`                                             | Left-to-right |
| Ternary operators               | `boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2` | Right-to-left |
| Assignment operators            | `= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= \|= <<= >>= >>>=`         | Right-to-left |
| Arrow operator                  | `->`                                             | Right-to-left |

### Some of uniry operator

```java
int pelican = !5;         // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean penguin = -true;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean peacock = !0;     // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

#### Logical complement**	`!a`	
Inverts a boolean's logical value
```java
boolean isAnimalAsleep = false;
System.out.print(isAnimalAsleep);  // false
isAnimalAsleep = !isAnimalAsleep;
System.out.print(isAnimalAsleep);  // true
```


#### Bitwise complement**	`~b`	
which flips all of the 0s and 1s in a number. It can only be applied to integer numeric types such as byte, short, char, int, and long. Let's try an example. For simplicity, we only show the last four bits (instead of all 32 bits).

```java
int value = 3;                   // Stored as 0011
int complement = ~value;         // Stored as 1100
System.out.println(value);       // 3
System.out.println(complement);  // -4
```

to find the bitwise complement of a number, multiply it by negative one and then subtract one.
```java
System.out.println(-1*value - 1);      // -4
System.out.println(-1*complement - 1); // 3
```

#### Negation operator

```java
double zooTemperature = 1.21;
System.out.println(zooTemperature);  // 1.21
zooTemperature = -zooTemperature;
System.out.println(zooTemperature);  // -1.21
zooTemperature = -(-zooTemperature);
System.out.println(zooTemperature);  // -1.21
```

#### Increment decrement operators

Pre-increment	`++w`	Increases the value by 1 and returns the **new** value

Pre-decrement	`--x`	Decreases the value by 1 and returns the **new** value

Post-increment	`y++`	Increases the value by 1 and returns the **original** value

Post-decrement	`z--`	Decreases the value by 1 and returns the **original** value

```java
int parkAttendance = 0;
System.out.println(parkAttendance);    // 0
System.out.println(++parkAttendance); // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance);    // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance--); // 1
System.out.println(parkAttendance);    // 0
```

> All of the arithmetic operators may be applied to any Java primitives, with the exception of boolean. Furthermore, only the addition operators + and += may be applied to String values, which results in String concatenation

#### Modulus 

```java
System.out.println(9 / 3);  // 3
System.out.println(9 % 3);  // 0
 
System.out.println(10 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(10 % 3); // 1
 
System.out.println(11 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(11 % 3); // 2
 
System.out.println(12 / 3); // 4
System.out.println(12 % 3); // 0
```

> For a given divisor y, the modulus operation results in a value between `0` and `(y - 1)` for positive dividends, or 0, 1, 2 in this example.

> The modulus operation is not limited to positive integer values in Java; it may also be applied to negative integers and floating-point numbers. For example, if the divisor is 5, then the modulus value of a negative number is between -4 and 0. 

## Numeric promotion

1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types.
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point value's data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely, byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time they're used with a Java binary arithmetic operator with a variable (as opposed to a value), even if neither of the operands is int.
4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.

> For the third rule, note that unary operators are excluded from this rule. For example, applying ++ to a short value results in a short value.

```java
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
var z = x * y; // long (first rule)
```

```java
short x = 10;
short y = 3;
var z = x * y; // int (third rule)
```

```java
double x = 39.21;
float y = 2.1; // doesn't compile
var z = x + y;
```

```java 
short w = 14;
float x = 13;
double y = 30;
var z = w * x / y; // double 
```

## Casting primitives

```java
int fish = 1.0;        // DOES NOT COMPILE
short bird = 1921222;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
int mammal = 9f;       // DOES NOT COMPILE
long reptile = 192_301_398_193_810_323;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

fix
```java
int fish = (int)1.0;
short bird = (short)1921222;  // Stored as 20678
int mammal = (int)9f;
long reptile = (long)192301398193810323;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
long reptile = 192301398193810323L
```
---
```java
short mouse = 10;
short hamster = 3;
short capybara = mouse * hamster;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
fix
```java
short mouse = 10;
short hamster = 3;
short capybara = (short)(mouse * hamster);
```
---
```java
short mouse = 10;
short hamster = 3;
short capybara = (short)mouse * hamster;      // DOES NOT COMPILE
short capybara = 1 + (short)(mouse * hamster);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

> compiler doesn't require casting when working with literal values that fit into the data type

```java
byte hat = 1;
byte gloves = 7 * 10;
short scarf = 5;
short boots = 2 + 1;
```

```java
short boots = 2 + hat;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
byte gloves = 7 * 100;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

Compaund operates can handle casting
```java
long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep = sheep * goat;   // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

```java
long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep *= goat;  // The compound operator will first cast sheep to a long, apply the multiplication of two long values, and then cast the result to an int. 
```

assignment with assignment
```java
long wolf = 5;
long coyote = (wolf=3);
System.out.println(wolf);   // 3
System.out.println(coyote); // 3
```
and as well
```java
long wolf = 5;
long coyote = (wolf=3);
long tiger = wolf = coyote = 10;
System.out.println(wolf);   // 10
System.out.println(coyote); // 10
 System.out.println(tiger); // 10
```

```java
boolean healthy = false;
if(healthy = true)
   System.out.print("Good!");
```

## Comparison

```java
boolean monkey = true == 3;       // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean ape = false != "Grape";   // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean gorilla = 10.2 == "Koko"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

```java
boolean bear = false;
boolean polar = (bear = true);
System.out.println(polar);  // true
```

```java
var monday = new File("schedule.txt");
var tuesday = new File("schedule.txt");
var wednesday = tuesday;
System.out.println(monday == tuesday);    // false
System.out.println(tuesday == wednesday); // true
```

```java
System.out.print(null == null);  // true
```

> If the compiler can determine that a variable cannot possibly be cast to a specific class, it reports an error.

```java
public void openZoo(Number time) {
   if(time instanceof String) // DOES NOT COMPILE
      System.out.print(time);
}
```

```java
System.out.print(null instanceof Object);  // false
 
Object noObjectHere = null;
System.out.print(noObjectHere instanceof String);  // false
System.out.print(null instanceof null);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

```java
if(duck!=null & duck.getAge()<5) { // Could throw a NullPointerException
   // Do something
}
```

```java
if(duck!=null && duck.getAge()<5) {
   // Do something
}
```

## Ternary Operator tricks

```java
int food1 = owl < 4 ? owl > 2 ? 3 : 4 : 5;
int food2 = (owl < 4 ? ((owl > 2) ? 3 : 4) : 5)
```

> there is no requirement that second and third expressions in ternary operations have the same data types, although it does come into play when combined with the assignment operator
```java
int stripes = 7;
 
System.out.print((stripes > 5) ? 21 : "Zebra");
 
int animal = (stripes < 9) ? 3 : "Horse";  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

```java
int sheep = 1;
int zzz = 1;
int sleep = zzz < 10 ? sheep++ : zzz++;
System.out.print(sleep + "," + sheep + "," + zzz);  // 1,2,1
```    

```java
int sheep = 1;
int zzz = 1;
int sleep = sheep>=10 ? sheep++ : zzz++;
System.out.print(sleep + "," + sheep + "," + zzz);  // 1,1,2
```
