I want to start attempts for scripting for dev-env. The main thing is every new laptop or desktop requires a set of operation to configure dev environment. It's quite long and stupid. Yes of course it happen not too often but. I want to automate this process. 

# Attempts

1. Download ubuntu iso file from official cite

[Ubuntu 22 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso?_ga=2.51843945.1576195709.1673520811-839719946.1671634417)
