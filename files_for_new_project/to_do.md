## Thoughts

I want to keep notes in good state. 
- locust
  - set up python sandbox as simple as possible with mininum files. 
  - skim documentaion. Possible that there is some cool features. 



what I want to try
- go
- rust
- swift and xcode, something for ios development.

I want to polish existing repo. It should be in consistent state up to date. 
- open separately develop and sql branches. 
- open commit log. Actually it is too big PR. Start a new branches and try to cherry pick first commits. 

I want to create my first app for iphone. 
- ask chat gpt how to do that
- start notes. 

I want revise my knowledge in IT
- just a run scripts.
- do I have some sandbox?
