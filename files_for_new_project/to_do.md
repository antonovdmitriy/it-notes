## Thoughts

  - explain contants of locust.py
  - up image and try again
  - how I can connect to web ui.
  - add to notes how to use loucts and compose
  - expose port 
  - install locust without container
  - add to notes

what I want to try
- go
- rust
- swift and xcode, something for ios development.

I want to polish existing repo. It should be in consistent state up to date. 
- open separately develop and sql branches. 
- open commit log. Actually it is too big PR. Start a new branches and try to cherry pick first commits.
