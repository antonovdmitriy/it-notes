- An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task

- The study of algorithms is concerned with both **correctness** (will this algorithm work for all input?) and **performance** (is this the most efficient way to solve this problem?).

Generally you want to choose the most efficient algorithm—whether you’re trying to optimize for time or space.

## Binary search 

Binary search is an algorithm; its input is a sorted list of elements. With binary search, you guess the middle number and eliminate half the remaining numbers every time. For any list of n, binary search will take $log_2n$ n steps to run in the worst case, whereas simple search will take n steps.

```java
    int binarySearch(int arr[], int x)
    {
        int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
 
            // Check if x is present at mid
            if (arr[m] == x)
                return m;
 
            // If x greater, ignore left half
            if (arr[m] < x)
                l = m + 1;
 
            // If x is smaller, ignore right half
            else
                r = m - 1;
        }
 
        // If we reach here, then element was
        // not present
        return -1;
    }
```


## Big O notation 
Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows. Big O establishes a worst-case run time

+ O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
+ O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
+ O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
+ O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort
+ O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson

## Memory addresses arrays and linked list

Sometimes you need to store a list of elements in memory. Suppose you’re writing an app to manage your todos. You’ll want to store the todos as a list in memory. 

 Using an array means all your tasks are stored contiguously (right next to each other) in memory. Now suppose you want to add a fourth task. But the next drawer is taken up by someone else’s stuff! It’s like going to a movie with your friends and finding a place to sit—but another friend joins you, and there’s no place for them. You have to move to a new spot where you all fit. In this case, you need to ask your computer for a different chunk of memory that can fit four tasks. Then you need to move all your tasks there. If another friend comes by, you’re out of room again—and you all have to move a second time! What a pain. Similarly, adding new items to an array can be a big pain. If you’re out of space and need to move to a new spot in memory every time, adding a new item will be really slow. One easy fix is to “hold seats”: even if you have only 3 items in your task list, you can ask the computer for 10 slots, just in case. Then you can add 10 items to your task list without having to move. This is a good workaround, but you should be aware of a couple of downsides:

You may not need the extra slots that you asked for, and then that memory will be wasted. You aren’t using it, but no one else can use it either.
You may add more than 10 items to your task list and have to move anyway.
So it’s a good workaround, but it’s not a perfect solution. Linked lists solve this problem of adding items.

With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores the address of the next item in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together.

It’s like a treasure hunt. You go to the first address, and it says, “The next item can be found at address 123.” So you go to address 123, and it says, “The next item can be found at address 847,” and so on. Adding an item to a linked list is easy: you stick it anywhere in memory and store the address with the previous item.

With linked lists, you never have to move your items. You also avoid another problem. Let’s say you go to a popular movie with five of your friends. The six of you are trying to find a place to sit, but the theater is packed. There aren’t six seats together. Well, sometimes this happens with arrays. Let’s say you’re trying to find 10,000 slots for an array. Your memory has 10,000 slots, but it doesn’t have 10,000 slots together. You can’t get space for your array! A linked list is like saying, “Let’s split up and watch the movie.” If there’s space in memory, you have space for your linked list.

Suppose you want to read the last item in a linked list. You can’t just read it, because you don’t know what address it’s at. Instead, you have to go to item #1 to get the address for item #2. Then you have to go to item #2 to get the address for item #3. And so on, until you get to the last item. Linked lists are great if you’re going to read all the items one at a time: you can read one item, follow the address to the next item, and so on. But if you’re going to keep jumping around, linked lists are terrible.

Arrays are different. You know the address for every item in your array. For example, suppose your array contains five items, and you know it starts at address 00. What is the address of item #5?  Simple math tells you: it’s 04. Arrays are great if you want to read random elements, because you can look up any element in your array instantly. With a linked list, the elements aren’t next to each other, so you can’t instantly calculate the position of the fifth element in memory—you have to go to the first element to get the address to the second element, then go to the second element to get the address of the third element, and so on until you get to the fifth element.

It’s worth mentioning that insertions and deletions are O(1) time only if you can instantly access the element to be deleted. It’s a common practice to keep track of the first and last items in a linked list, so it would take only O(1) time to delete those.

##  traveling salesperson problem.

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.
